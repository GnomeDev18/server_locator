# server_locator
This program uses Socket and Geocoder to find both the location and the ip address. Socket gets the IP and geocoder finds the location. Just type in the address, like github.com, and it will tell the ip address, the city, and the coordinates.
This was run on Python 3.5.3, and I think it should work until an update makes socket, geocoder, or python 3 incompatible.
The requirements are that you have Socket and Geocoder installed.
